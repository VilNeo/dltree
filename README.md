#dltree

##About

***dltree* is a library that provides a double linked tree with leaf-considering typing.**

##Current state

The current implementation is well tested but far from being stable.
Several future changes will be implemented until the first stable version 1.0:

 - [ ] Add documentation to all public structures and methods
 - [ ] Remove all panicking elements and return Result<T,E> instead
 - [ ] Add missing methods like insertion of children (in addition to just pushing)
 - [ ] Reevaluate the mutability of all methods
 - [ ] Add concise documentation how to use ***dltree*** in README.md

##Donation
